<h2 class='subtitle'>Dr Mahsa and Dr Brandon Nejati</h2>
<div class='col'>
<p>Nejati clinic founders, Dr Mahsa (GDC No:83036) and Dr Brandon Nejati (GDC No:82664), have more than 20 years experience in holistic dentistry. Their mission is “Treating the Whole You” with the understanding that being unwell in one aspect affects you in others.</p>
<p>With their unique formulations and revolutionary approach, you will step into a world where self care takes on a new dimension, where your oral ritual is elevated into an art form. Because true radiance starts with a healthy you.</p>
<details>
<summary>Manifesto</summary>
<div class='col'>
<p>We created MAHSA and the Nejati Clinic because we believed the mouth is a gateway for the rest of the body and oral health affects systemic health. That natural ingredients that mimics the nature are far better for your well-being than any other chemicals put together in an artificial way.</p>

Anti Ageing Dentistry
</h3>
<h4>Dr Bradon Nejati</h4>
<p>With over two decades of experience, Dr. Brandon Nejati, founder of Nejati Clinic in Belgravia, London, revolutionizes aesthetic dentistry with his non-invasive, anti-aging techniques, notably the signature Micro-Layering Treatment, focusing on proactive and preventative care to maintain youthful smiles.</p>

<summary>Learn more</summary>
<div class='col'>
<p>With a legacy spanning two decades, leading London-based aesthetic dentist, Dr Brandon Nejati, founder of the Nejati Clinic based in Belgravia, London, has been transforming smiles into natural and exquisite works of art in a totally non invasive way. Having graduated from Gothenburg university, Sweden over two decades ago, Dr Nejati has been in the forefront of innovating techniques in anti-ageing dentistry.</p>
<p>In contrast to conventional and traditional thinking, which primarily address issues in their advanced stages to tackle discomfort and pain, Dr. Nejati’s ethos revolves around a deliberate deceleration and reversal of the dental aging process. This philosophy is rooted in a proactive and safeguarding approach, seeking to prevent and preempt potential problems in later stages.</p>
<p>It is this approach that inspired Dr Nejati’s magnum opus signature Micro-Layering Treatment, which can be introduced both with nano composites and porcelain.</p>
