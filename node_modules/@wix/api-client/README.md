# `@wix/api-client`

### This package has been deprecated in favor of `@wix.sdk`!
> The package has been renamed to `@wix/sdk` and this package remains for backwards compatbility.
We will continue publishing versions of `@wix/api-client` to match `@wix/sdk` until we fully depreacte it.
Please move to using `@wix/sdk` as soon as possible.

See [`@wix/sdk`](../sdk/) for information about the Wix SDK.
