/**
 * Creates a URL for redirecting a visitor from an external client site to a Wix page for Wix-managed functionality.
 *
 *
 * The `createRedirectSession()` function enables your external Wix Headless client site, built on any platform, to integrate Wix-managed frontend functionality for specific processes.
 * For example, your site can temporarily redirect a visitor to Wix for authentication, or for a checkout process for a bookings, eCommerce, events, or paid plans transaction.
 *
 * To initiate a redirect session:
 *
 * 1. Call `createRedirectSession()` with the details required for Wix to take care of one specific process (for example, authentication or a bookings checkout). Provide one or more callback URLs, so Wix can redirect the user back to your site as appropriate when the process is over.
 * 1. Redirect your visitor to the URL provided in the response. This URL includes query parameters informing Wix where to redirect the visitor back to on your external site.
 * 1. Make sure the pages at the callback URLs you provided take care of the next stages in your visitor flow.
